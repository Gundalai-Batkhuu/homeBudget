# Personal Budgeting App

## Description

This is a lightweight personal budgeting app that allows users to track their expenses and income. The app provides a summary of the user's total expenses and income via data visualisation dashboards. The app is built using Python and the user data is stored in a locally hosted Postgresql database. It has two viewing modes: a desktop mode and a web mode. The desktop view is built using PySimpleGui while the web view is built using Streamlit.
